# ðŸš€ Complete Cloudflare R2 Setup Guide (2025 Dashboard)

## Step 1: Access R2 in Cloudflare Dashboard

1. **Login to Cloudflare Dashboard**
   - Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/
   - Use your account credentials

2. **Navigate to R2**
   - In the left sidebar, look for **"R2 Object Storage"**
   - Click on **"R2 Object Storage"**
   - If you don't see it, look under **"Storage"** or **"Products"**

## Step 2: Create R2 Bucket

1. **Create Bucket**
   - Click **"Create bucket"** (blue button)
   - **Bucket name**: `the-social-twin-storage` (use exactly this name)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users (e.g., Eastern North America)
   - **Storage Class**: Standard
   - Leave other settings as default
   - Click **"Create bucket"**

2. **Configure Bucket Settings**
   - Once created, click on your bucket name
   - Go to **"Settings"** tab
   - Under **"Public access"**, click **"Allow Access"**
   - Confirm by typing the bucket name
   - This makes files publicly readable via URL

## Step 3: Create R2 API Token (CRITICAL STEP)

1. **Navigate to R2 API Tokens**
   - In the R2 dashboard, look for **"Manage R2 API tokens"** 
   - OR go to **"My Profile"** â†’ **"API Tokens"** â†’ **"R2 API Tokens"**

2. **Create New Token**
   - Click **"Create API token"**
   - **Token name**: `social-twin-r2-access`

3. **Configure Permissions (IMPORTANT)**
   - **Permissions**: Select **"Admin Read & Write"** 
   - **Account resources**: Include **"All accounts"**
   - **Zone resources**: Include **"All zones"**
   - **Bucket scope**: Select **"Apply to specific buckets only"**
   - Choose your bucket: `the-social-twin-storage`

4. **Additional Settings**
   - **Client IP Address Filtering**: Leave blank (allow all IPs)
   - **TTL**: Leave as default (no expiration)

## Step 4: Save Credentials

After creating the token, you'll see:

```
Access Key ID: [Copy this - starts with letters/numbers]
Secret Access Key: [Copy this - long alphanumeric string]
Token: [This is for other uses, not needed for S3 API]
```

**IMPORTANT**: Copy these immediately - they won't be shown again!

## Step 5: Update Your Environment File

Replace your R2 credentials in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Replace these with your NEW credentials
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=ced616f33f6492fd708a8e897b61b953  # Keep this same
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_KEY_ID]
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[YOUR_NEW_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_KEY_ID]     # Same as above
CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[YOUR_NEW_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]  # Same as above
R2_BUCKET_NAME=the-social-twin-storage
R2_BUCKET_PUBLIC_URL=https://ced616f33f6492fd708a8e897b61b953.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/the-social-twin-storage
```

## Step 6: Test the Setup

After updating credentials:

```bash
node test-r2-upload-real.js
```

You should see:
```
âœ… R2 Upload successful!
âœ… File is publicly accessible!
```

## Step 7: Configure Custom Domain (Optional but Recommended)

1. **In your R2 bucket settings**
   - Go to **"Settings"** â†’ **"Custom Domains"**
   - Click **"Connect Domain"**
   - Enter: `cdn.thesocialtwin.com` (or your subdomain)
   - Follow DNS setup instructions

2. **Update environment if using custom domain**
   ```bash
   R2_BUCKET_PUBLIC_URL=https://cdn.thesocialtwin.com
   ```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Access Denied" Error
- **Solution**: Recreate API token with "Admin Read & Write" permissions
- Make sure bucket scope includes your specific bucket

### "NoSuchBucket" Error  
- **Solution**: Double-check bucket name matches exactly in environment file
- Ensure bucket was created successfully

### "Invalid Credentials" Error
- **Solution**: Copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key correctly
- Make sure no extra spaces or characters

### Files Upload but Not Accessible
- **Solution**: Enable public access on the bucket
- Check the public URL format is correct

## Expected Result

After proper setup:
1. âœ… New AI generations save to permanent R2 storage
2. âœ… Gallery shows all generated content  
3. âœ… History persists across sessions
4. âœ… Fast loading from Cloudflare CDN
5. âœ… No more black galleries!

## Next Steps After R2 Works

1. Test a generation in your app
2. Check if new content appears in gallery
3. Run migration for existing content:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/social-twin/migrate-to-r2
   ```

The key difference in the new dashboard is ensuring the API token has **"Admin Read & Write"** permissions specifically scoped to your bucket!
